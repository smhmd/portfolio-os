# Portfolio OS

An OS-like website that showcases hosts a bunch of useful (and less than useful) apps.

## IDEAS

- Apps:
  - Pixel art Editor
  - Dice generator (like Google's Dice Roll)
  - Drum Machine (e.g., https://www.musicca.com/drum-machine)
  - A museum for my personal generative art
  - An app that once you click, you get a "pet" like Window's clippy that looks at your actions and comments on them (could be hooked up to an AI chatbot)
  - Roll-and-Write Playground
  - Flappy Bird
  - Ping Pong (maybe)
  - Pac-man (Maybe)
  - Tic-Tac-Toe (the one that your choice disappears after a while)
  - Achievements in the OS itself
