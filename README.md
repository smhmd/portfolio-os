# Portfolio OS

An OS-like website that showcases hosts a bunch of useful (and less than useful) apps.

## Ideas

### Games:

- 2048 Puzzle: A version of 2048 where no new tiles spawn. The goal is to merge all tiles within a limited number of moves. Introduce tiles that can go out of bounds, adding a unique and counterintuitive twist to the gameplay.
- Flappy Bird: A classic Flappy Bird game.
- Pac-Man: A potential addition of the iconic Pac-Man game.
- Ping Pong: A simple Ping Pong game (under consideration).
- Tic-Tac-Toe: A unique twist on Tic-Tac-Toe where your choices disappear after a short time, adding a time-pressure element.

### Creative Tools:

- Pixel Art Editor: A tool for creating pixel art.
- Drum Machine: A virtual drum machine for creating beats (similar to Musicca's Drum Machine).
- Generative Art Museum: A dedicated space to showcase your personal generative art projects.
- Roll-and-Write Playground: A digital space for roll-and-write game mechanics.

### Utilities:

- Dice Generator: A simple dice-rolling tool, similar to Google's Dice Roll.
- Typing Test with Ranking: A typing test that assigns a rank (from F to S) based on performance, rather than just showing average typing speeds.
- Globe + Images: A visual tool inspired by Picto.World to explore images on a globe.
- Chatbox: A widget that greets users so that they can chat among themselves like private trackers.

### OS:

- Virtual Pet: An app that spawns a virtual pet (like Windows' Clippy) that observes your actions and comments on them.
- Achievements System: Integrate an achievements system into the OS itself, rewarding users for completing specific tasks or milestones.
